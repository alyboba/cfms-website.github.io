            ">Hello CFMS Members!</p>
                    <p>My name is Victoria Januszkiewicz and I am a 3rd year at MUN. I am delighted to be putting my name forward for your CFMS VP Communications.</p>
                    <p>I have had the pleasure of working with members from across the country this year as I am just finishing my term as your Atlantic Representative. Above all, connecting with members has been my favourite experience thus far, which is why I decided that this is something I would love to continue doing as your VP Communications.</p>
                    <p>Through my term on the board I have gained a variety of skills, including: General Meeting planning, developing media campaigns for our different awards, and working with our comms team for the past 5 months to create our communiques. I believe that I can bring what I have gained this year forward, to help us continue to grow and ensure we meet our full potential in terms of our branding and public image as an organization.</p>
                    <p>I believe that through the new communications sub-committees designed this year and through increased delegation to our MANY capable members, the capacity of our communications team can grow and CFMS can continue to further spread its impact and message through timely communications, powerful press releases, and strong social media campaigns/content.</p>
                    <p>I would be honoured to continue to represent the CFMS as a board member and I appreciate your time and consideration of me for this position.</p>

            ">I am a first year medical student at the University of Toronto and I hope to be the next Vice-President Communications for the CFMS.</p>
                    <p>One of the privileges of growing up in a large city like Toronto is that there is no shortage of experiential opportunities. From a young age, I've volunteered and worked for a number of organizations that are headquartered in the Greater Toronto Area, and through them, have accumulated a set of skills that uniquely position me to assist our President in serving the aims of CFMS.</p>
                    <p>I have a knack for crafting polished content and creatives that effectively and accurately convey an organization's message to it's audience and the media. Put together with my tremendous passion for health advocacy, and enlivening vision to amplify the profile of CFMS, this makes me the ideal candidate for this role. I want the CFMS to have a stronger presence in front of Canadians.</p>
                    <p>I have served in official communications roles for numerous community organizations, including University Health Network, Humanity First, AhmadiyyaCanada, World Media Forum, StopTheCrisis.ca, and Toronto-area Liberals among others. I am exceedingly well-versed in the skills of public affairs, media relations, copywriting, social media and e-mail marketing, multimedia and print-media projects. Most recently, I have worked as the architect of an innovative patient education program at UHN, CardiacClinic.ca.</p>
                    <p>I encourage you to review my CV, hear my speech which further outlines my vision for CFMS, and entrust me with the role of your next VP Communications.</p>

                        I’m Maylynn, a final year student at McMaster, and I’m asking for your support to serve as the next VP Education. My involvement with the CFMS began in first-year as the Education Committee Vice-Chair and this past year, I had the privilege of serving as an Ontario representive and attaché to the Education portfolio. In this role, I had the incredible opportunity to represent medical students on AFMC and CaRMS committees, and provide feedback on key reports.  Anyone who knows me knows I love the CFMS, and the Education portfolio is especially close to my heart. 250 words cannot do it justice—so please find me and ask me questions. As VP Education, one of my priorities will be to further our work in supporting unmatched Canadian medical students. This is the first year the unmatched student network was run and we will look into methods of expanding it sustainably while respecting privacy. Competency-based medical education (CBME) is another big topic. As more residency programs adopt it, there is much to be done in understanding how best to prepare students in transitioning into residency and the role of CBME at the undergraduate level.  Lastly, I hope to continue the CFMS’ ongoing advocacy efforts to improve the AFMC electives portal, CaRMS Online, and learner privacy. The medical education landscape is constantly evolving and medical students must be included in the important conversations taking place. I hope you will trust me to be the strong, reliable voice we need at the table.

            ">Hello CFMS members,</p>
                    <p>My name is Henry Li, a second-year medical student at the University of Manitoba, and I am honoured to be running for Vice-President Finance (VPF) of the CFMS.</p>
                    <p>I first became involved in the CFMS when I joined the Finance, Audit, and Human Resources committee last fall. Since then, I have had the privilege of contributing to the financial health of our organization. I have not only gained new skills, but also a profound appreciation of everything that the CFMS provides for its members during the challenging times of medical school. Unfortunately, money is often a limiting factor in what we can accomplish. That is why I am running for VPF.</p>
                    <p>Aside from my role in the CFMS, I am also involved as the Junior Treasurer of the Manitoba Medical Students Association, and my experience in non-profit finances dates back to 2012. I believe that my past experiences and understanding of the CFMS’ finances would help me further improve our financial position and contribute to the well-being of medical students across Canada. In particular, I would aim to reassess and balance our investments, improve our funding sustainability and diversification, as well as create human resource policies in preparation for the hiring of an Executive Director and other staff.</p>
                    <p>I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to contribute to the CFMS and hope that you will give me the honour of serving as your Vice-President Finance for the 2018-2019 year.</p>
                    <p>Regards,</p>

            ">My vision for the CFMS VP Finance is to increase funding for CFMS educational and advocacy programs:</p>
                    <p>1. Obtain charitable status or partner with charities to apply for grants and support CRA-eligible activities.</p>
                    <p>2. Have the ability to write tax receipts through charitable status or partnerships.</p>
                    <p>I am passionate about forging relationships and programs for a holistic, transformational, approach to healthcare for all people. With lived experience in both the LGBTQ+ and Indigenous communities, I want to improve the experience of care through preventative practices, increased patient-provider relationships, and increased patient health knowledge.</p>
                    <p>I bring some new perspectives to the CFMS in financial governance, sponsorship, and divestment. In the for profit sector, I directly led 150+ employees with a $50 MM budget before entering medical school. I personally hired over 120 people, have negotiated $3 MM+ lawsuit settlements, and have mitigated residual risk for the business operations. In the not for profit sector, I am treasurer of the 2022 Medical Student’s Class Council and the Treasurer of the Edmonton Men’s Health Collective (EMHC), a local grassroots health charity run for and by GBTQ men. As Treasurer, I complete all financial statements, reports, and CRA filings. In addition, I advocate for HIV prevention, Mental Health First Aid, and Naloxone training, physician education. During my time at EMHC, we received formal recognition with CRA Charitable Status. As a result, our budget increased from $15,000/year to $85,000/year.</p>

            ">Dear Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) Members,</p>
                    <p>This is an expression of interest for the position of 2018-2019 CFMS Vice President of Finance. As a third-year medical student with a variety of experience within medical leadership organizations, I believe I have the skills necessary to be an ideal fit for this position.</p>
                    <p>I have been involved in various bodies, including the Student Medical Society of Saskatchewan as their 2016-2018 VP External and the CFMS as the 2017-2018 Western Regional Representative. These roles have also given me the opportunity to serve as a student representative on a variety of committees, which have provided me with a wealth of experience that would enhance my abilities as CFMS VP Finance. For example, I assisted in the formulation of two Medical Society budgets at the University of Saskatchewan, one of which included a comprehensive line-by-line review. In addition, I have been a member of the CFMS Finance and Governance Committees and have helped to review budgets at the Saskatchewan Medical Association and the local Alumni Association.</p>
                    <p>I am excited to be running in this election, as the CFMS is in a period of growth with a lot of opportunity, not only within the Finance Portfolio, but the organization as a whole. To maximize the value of this opportunity I would utilize my extensive organizational knowledge and budgetary experience to provide the CFMS with a guiding hand to fulfill our vision of Tomorrow’s Physicians Leading for Health Today.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>As medical trainees we are in a unique position to advocate and speak towards issues of public importance, with the opportunity to add to dialogue productively and passionately, being in a position of inherent privilege. We must be an example to others, as current and future leaders in healthcare, grounded in values and principles of social accountability and responsibility.</p>
                    <p>I aim to continue to build capacity for CFMS within and beyond the Government Affairs and Advocacy file, empower leadership in others, foster current and new organizational/governmental relationships, and continue to foster our organization that we are all proud of – one that effectively represents and advocates for its members, and our future patients to fully embody our vision, ‘Tomorrow’s physicians leading for health today”.</p>

            ">With great enthusiasm, I submit my nomination for VP Government Affairs, a great match for me given my past experience as President of the Medical Society, CFMS representative for UofT, and most recently, as an intern and consultant for the Vienna-based United Nations.</p>
                    <p>Through my experience as MedSoc President, I developed strong leadership and communication skills. As the elected President, I represented our over 1,000 medical students to Faculty leadership and external organizations, I sat on numerous faculty councils to advocate in the best interests of students, and I managed 18 diverse Executive Council portfolios. In this role, I was able to successfully advocate for institutional changes to the Faculty's professionalism policy and clerkship surgical exam. Moreover, learned from U of T students that they needed more careers and mental health resources. As such, I worked with our MedSoc and Faculty to launch a new MedSoc careers portfolio, a full review of related resources, and a Career Fair event. With respect to mental health, I piloted a free voluntary safeTALK program, allowing interested students to gain basic suicide intervention skills. </p>
                    <p>My time at the UN has given me experience in healthcare policy and government affairs. I participated in conferences and Expert Group Meetings, published technical reports and guidelines, and corresponded with governments and international organizations regarding healthcare policies.</p>
                    <p>I have always admired the CFMS and wanted to be on the Executive Board. Given my experience, I would love to represent the 8,000 CMFS members as VP Government Affairs.</p>

            ">These past two years within CFMS has lead me a variety of opportunities within health policy. From being a member of the Committee of Health Policy to its National officer, responsible for many sub-groups and task forces, it’s been a whirlwind of new experiences.</p>
                    <p>My intentions were from the start to engage, tailor and focus policy writing within CFMS, from re-organizing the structure of how papers make it to the General Meeting floor (creative process, written formats, research, writing, revisions) to follow-up on the papers that were passed. The strategies within ensuring accountability within the papers and their recommendations translated into oversight on advocacy initiatives and steps. From organizing research studies stemming from papers within the case of our refugee and migrant health paper, to collaborating with external organizations in the topics of solitary confinement, from consultations done for the homelessness task force, to national campaign planning for the national seniors strategy task force, it seemed like my role was expanding. And it was all my doing. Throughout all of this, keeping track of the committee of health policy and collaborations with other committees (i.e. GAAC, GHA and NORP) kept more ideas coming. More students were being encouraged to take on leadership positions within these aspects and it was my utmost pleasure supporting them. </p>
                    <p>It’s been a long ride, and as the end of this role comes, I continue to oversee some teams and want more. That is what lead me to the thought process of running for this position.</p>

                        While being a medical student comes with much excitement and privilege, coping with long hours, stressful working and learning environments (which often are not fully supportive of learners), challenges of patient care and balancing family and personal commitments are a daunting task. That upwards of one-third of pre-clerkship students and half of clerks report significant burnout is only one measure that shows we must continue to improve student supports. Our members should not graduate with mountains of debt, feeling burnt out and having experienced mistreatment from other medical colleagues.</p>
                        <p>I want to be your Director of Student Affairs for the 2018-2019 year so that we can continue advocating for a health-promoting working and learning environment for all medical trainees. We must continue to raise awareness and de-stigmatize the reality that we all face mental, physical and other health challenges during medical school. Our programming must be more comprehensive (including our responsibility to continue pursuing and improving existing student discounts/partnerships that support our education, travel and more)  and we must continue to build resilience through unique personal development opportunities. I have had the pleasure of leading the development and implementation of the National Wellness Program and I yearn for the opportunity to further develop this project  with other national stakeholders, all medical faculties and most importantly you, the students, who deserve a CFMS student affairs teams that advocates relentlessly for you. It would be an honour to support, connect and represent you this year.

                        Hi everyone, my name is Michelle Quaye and I am running to be Director of Global Health for the Canadian Federation of Medical Students. I am a third-year medical student at Western’s Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry. I have a strong interest in global health and am currently National Officer of Partnerships for CFMS’ Global Health Program; as well, I recently completed my term as Global Health Liaison for my medical school student society. Through my medical school, I am carrying out research on global mental health and social enterprise in partnership with a Kenyan community, for which I completed a program based in Canada and Kenya called the Global MINDS Fellowship. I have had the privilege of representing the CFMS at the 2017 March Meeting of the International Federation of Medical Students’ Associations (IFMSA) and have continued my involvement with the IFMSA since then in different roles. If elected as Director of Global Health, I will strive to ensure the global health portfolio transitions smoothly with its new structure. I aim to increase engagement with the IFMSA, not only in terms of CFMS member engagement, but also with how the CFMS uses its voice to influence new initiatives and improvements to the IFMSA’s work.  Ultimately, my goal is to ensure that all CFMS members are supported in enriching their knowledge on global health, international development and public health through formal and informal medical education, and local/national/international experiential opportunities. Please reach out to me if you have any questions!

The Western Regional Director serves an important role by being a liaison between Western schools, and linking the Western schools with the broader CFMS community. At the core of my platform is a desire to better engage with students and faculty across provinces. Along with supporting existing initiatives, I hope to carry out my role with an additional emphasis on integrating digital technology in the way we engage with schools. My platform will focus on building teleconferencing and social media opportunities to foster inter-school relations, provide students with more flexible options for attending inter-school events, and working to create more opportunities for student-faculty engagement.</p>
                    <p>Previously, I served on the Governing Council at the University of Toronto. I had the opportunity to represent over 24,000 full time undergraduate students across 3 campuses in matters relating to academic policy, student wellness, and academic appeals. I also liaised with legal counsel, academic chairs and students, and reporting back to the tribunal chair. This experience has honed my level of comfort in fostering collaboration and communication between diverse groups, and understand what it means to be an effective member of a diverse team. As such, I believe I am well prepared for this position.</p>
                    <p>I hope to meet each and every one of you in the upcoming days. Thank you for considering me as a Western Regional Director.</p>

                    <p>Throughout my experiences as a student, I’ve sought out opportunities to improve my community and make the lives and experiences of my peers more positive. One of the most rewarding opportunities where I pursued this passion was serving as president of the McMaster Medical Student Council. During this role, I thoroughly enjoyed engaging with students and creating actionable initiatives to meet their needs. One such example was developing a VP Student Affairs position this year to address concerns surrounding student wellness and success. Similarly, I hope to engage with students across Ontario and listen to each and every concern. Not only do I hope to address those concerns on a national platform, but I want to be transparent and keep students involved throughout the process. I hope to accomplish this by consistently communicating with medical societies as well as liaising with OMSA to ensure there is effective collaboration.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, my experience this past year with CFMS has been life-changing and extremely rewarding. Working with such passionate and knowledgeable individuals from across the country has truly been a pleasure.

                    <p>I am extremely excited to be presenting my candidacy for Quebec Regional Director.</p>
                    <p>Over the past year, I’ve been the CFMS’s Junior National Officer of Information Technologies. In this role, I co-developed the CFMS’s new website, advanced its IT agenda and supported ongoing initiatives such as the Longitudinal Wellness Initiative. I worked closely with the Board, as well as representatives from each of the CFMS’s major portfolios, and was thus fortunate to gain an excellent understanding of all of their projects. I am constantly impressed by the excellent work conducted by my peers across the country and would be humbled to represent you as a regional representative during the 2018-2019 year. </p>
                    <p>The AGMs are unique in the way that representatives from each Canadian medical school are here to discuss, debate, and share ideas. We should take this opportunity to continue collaborating and uniting the FMEQ and CFMS’s voices to work towards our common goals – from the unmatched issue to healthcare policy advocacy. As Quebec Director, I will play an active role in promoting and facilitating collaboration between both organizations. Furthermore, I will be attentive to the ongoing projects of the FMEQ and CFMS and find ways to involve historically disconnected Quebec students in pan-Canadian discussions. Having started with Sarah the Bilingualism IT Committee, I’m confident in my capacities to make the CFMS even more bilingual.</p>
                    <p>I would be delighted to serve you this year on the Board and thank you again for considering my application.</p>

                        My name is Dax Bourcier and I’m a 3rd year MD/MSc candidate at l’Université de Sherbrooke – Moncton campus. Following the completion of my undergraduate degree in microbiology and immunology with a minor in business, I worked as the employability and entrepreneurship advisor in Senegal for eight months. This experience sparked my motivation to promote the advancement in my community. As our MedSoc class representative in my first year, I created and led three activities promoting men’s mental health throughout the month of Movember. During second year, I became president of our MedSoc, where I was involved with the CFMS (Governance committee, President’s roundtable), and the FMEQ (President’s roundtable). Through these opportunities, I learned exponentially on the Canadian health ecosystem, and got the chance to connect with other remarkably determined students. For our delocalized campus of about 100 students overall, the CFMS was an incredible source of information and guidance. We have been able to tackle long-standing local issues, and have record numbers of Moncton students currently involved with the CFMS and externally. Through this work and more, I am honoured to be a recipient of the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame Award for medical students. Ensuring that the voices of our students are heard, and bringing change to Atlantic provinces’ issues through provincial and national advocacy, is fundamentally why I am running for the CFMS Atlantic Director. Additionally, equally important is communicating CFMS opportunities and collaborating with MUN, Dal and Moncton promoting student implication. Thank you for your consideration.
