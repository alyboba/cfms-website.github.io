              The ratio of available residency spots to Canadian medical
              students has declined steadily since 2009, and the number of
              unmatched medical students has increased. The CFMS endorses: 1)
              Unmatched graduates of Canadian medical students are an
              inappropriate outcome of the match process 2) For every 100
              Canadian medical student applicants there should be 120 residency
              spots, as per the Canadian Medical Association (CMA)
              recommendations 3) Every Canadian medical school must develop
              deliberate and well-considered policies to support unmatched
              medical students.

            paper-summary: >-
              Human trafficking is a relevant concern for Canadian HCP with
              severe effects on health and wellbeing of victims. Medical
              students and HCP are not adequately trained to recognize and
              assist victims. This paper advocates for curriculum incorporation
              of elements of raising awareness, providing validated screening
              tools and teaching how to identify and counsel vulnerable
              populations.

            paper-publish-date: '2016'
            paper-link: /files/position-papers/2016_advocacy and leadership.pdf
            paper-summary: >-
              In light of the need for medical students to develop their
              advocacy and leadership skills to be better prepared to advocate
              for the health needs of the patients and populations they serve,
              this paper calls for the creation of a mandatory Advocacy and
              Leadership Curriculum (ALC) in Canadian medical schools. This
              document is intended as a comprehensive resource for the CFMS and
              its members to support the integration and evaluation of ALCs in
              Canadian medical schools to enhance their social accountability.
              This paper includes proposed curriculum details such as the three
              spheres of health advocacy (patient level, institution level, and
              population level), advocacy preceptors, and health advocacy
              projects. Moreover, this paper includes several theoretical,
              skill-based, and application-based Learning Objectives that ALCs
              should address; a sample curriculum; sample competencies; and
              proposed implementation and evaluation guidelines.

              As of March 2016: While many medical students learn about the
              social determinants of health, little is taught in medical schools
              about the advocacy and leadership skills needed to act on this
              understanding of social issues in medicine. Some medical schools
              have faculty-supported advocacy curricula (e.g., the LEAD program
              at the University of Toronto) and some student-led health advocacy
              activities currently exist (e.g., lobby days). However, there is
              still a pressing need for increased social accountability in
              medical schools.

              Climate change and global health: Training future physicians to
              act and mitigate
            paper-publish-date: '2016'
            paper-link: /files/position-papers/2016_climate change and gh training.pdf
            paper-summary: >-
              Climate change poses several indirect hazards to human health,
              such as increasing incidence of vector-borne infectious diseases,
              cardio-respiratory related conditions and similar non-communicable
              diseases, as well as major disturbances to food and water systems.
              At particularly high risk are vulnerable populations such as the
              Inuit, who continue to witness firsthand current effects of
              climate change on their personal and ecosystem health. This is
              seen in greater trauma-related physical hazards due to melting
              ice, decreased stability of infrastructure due to melting
              permafrost, food insecurity, increased exposure to infectious
              disease through the sudden introduction of invasive species, water
              shortages and potential malnourishment. Meanwhile, direct impact
              of heat and air quality will likely be highest in Vancouver and
              Toronto, where annual cost of premature mortality risk
              attributable to climate change is expected to add up to $6.2
              billion annually. Mitigation measures such as air quality control
              can result in health co-benefits that offset cost of carbon
              policies by 1050%, whereas infrastructure modifications such as
              public transportation and urban settlement can further decrease
              risks of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and
              cardiovascular diseases.
            paper-status: >-
              The health community, through public and private institutions, is
              currently focusing on four overarching adaptions: researching
              health effects of climate change (through Health Canada, Canadian
              universities, etc.), activities at the federal, regional and
              health institutional level that directly or indirectly protect
              health, assessments of current levels of health adaptions in
              response to climate change, and communication of climate change
              health risks to the public. Health professionals who have
              participated in climate change advocacy have made significant
              contributions towards mitigation measures, such as air pollution
              research led by the CMA resulting in the decision to the phase out
              of coal-fired electricity in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta.
              Furthermore, health professionals have been involved in building
              assessment tools for tracking levels of health adaptions in
              response to climate change, such as the Air Quality Health Index
              (AQHI), heat alert response systems, and health vulnerability
              assessments. However, more work could be done to assess the
              effectiveness of such adaptions. At the undergraduate and
              postgraduate level in medical education, environmental health is
              one of the learning objects in Canadian medical education, but is
              not comprehensively explored. A successful example to look at when
              modelling climate change related medical education may include the
              work of the Sustainable Healthcare Education Network, which is a
              group of clinicians, students and academics in the UK dedicated to
              preparing health professionals for working in a low carbon health
              system.

              Less is More: Integration of Resource Stewardship in Medical
              Education

              medical education.pdf
            paper-summary: >-
              Resource stewardship is a concept focused on improving the quality
              of patient care by reducing the use of unnecessary medical testing
              and treatment, which is associated with false positives, increased
              patient anxiety, and preventable patient harm. As physicians
              control 80% of healthcare costs, it is crucial for medical
              students to learn and adopt practices in alignment of resource
              stewardship principles. The CFMS recognizes the importance of
              integrating resource stewardship into medical school curricula,
              and has created a list of behavioral recommendations for trainees
              aimed at creating a medical culture that celebrates the attitude
              of “less is more.” Going forward, there exists many opportunities
              to promote and support student-led initiatives focused on resource
              stewardship.
            paper-status: >-
              The University of Toronto has been a pioneer in the incorporation
              of resource stewardship into their curriculum, working closely
              with Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) to integrate it within all four
              years of their MD program. Other schools have also begun to do so,
              with many initatives being championed by students, such as the
              Students for Antimicrobial Stewardship Society. The CWC has also
              launched the STARS campaign, in which two medical students from
              each school are selected to champion the principles of resource
              stewardship at their school. In 2014, Canadian medical students
              and the CWC collaborated to create an online module for the
              Institute for Health Care Improvement titled "An Introduction to
              Quality, Value, and Cost in Health Care", which is the most
              popular non-mandatory module.

              This position paper summarizes the results of a nationwide survey
              on student perceptions of the Medical Student Performance Record
              (MSPR) document. Results were used to inform the recommendations
              put forward, which include: 1) Modification of the MSPR to
              minimize overlap with other CaRMS application documents, 2) Making
              medical students aware early in their training of the existence
              and prupose of the MSPR, and 3) Standardization of information
              collected on the MSPR by all medical schools across Canada

              A 2014 study (DOI: 10.3402/meo.v19.25181) on the heterogenity of
              information included on MSPR concluded that the information
              included in MSPR varied significantly between medical schools and
              concluded that standardization may be necessary in order for fair
              comparison to be made. However, no further action has been taken
              on this issue.

            paper-summary: >-
              The Canadian organ and tissue donation system relies heavily on
              physicians, who 1) identify and refer possible donors; 2)
              sensitively approach the caregivers of the deceseased; and #)
              provide appropriate patient education about consenting to organ
              donation. However, meidcal students and physicians posess limited
              knowledge for maximixing procurement rates. Despite this, organ
              and tissue donation is notably absent from most Canadian medical
              school curricula, posing a significant risk to the safety of
              patients and the public. This paper recommends the integration of
              a standardized, evidence-based course on organ and tissue donation
              into undergraduate medical curricula across Canada, responding
              both to the relevant LMCC objectives and the need for physicians
              to be able to provide effective counselling of patients and
              families.

              includes an example of the 3 hour curriculum satisfying LMCC
              objectives on organ donation in Quebec, which is endorsed by a
              number of provincial and national organizations. This paper
              encouraged the implementation of a similar curriculum in medical
              schools across Canada. It is not known whether this has been
              implemented at other schools across Canada (this would be worth
              looking into but would require directly contacting the schools or
              students from each school). To the best of my knowledge there is
              not a similar curriculum at the University of Calgary (my medical
              school). "

              Rural areas in Canada face a double burden of decreased access to
              maternity care and increase in need (more pregnancies and often
              higher risk due to social factors. Low risk delivery locally in
              rural settings should be an option when possible. In order to
              improve rural and remote maternity care CFMS recommends (1)
              Promoting awareness and support for rural practice (2) Organizing
              mentorship for students interested in obstetrics/rural medicine
              (3) Encourage interprofessional and community collaboration to
              optimize future service delivery

            paper-summary: >-
              Given the important role that clinician-scientists play in
              advancing evidence-based medicine, clinician-scientist training in
              Canada should be strengthened. Challenges currently encountered by
              clinician-scientist trainees include financial barriers, length of
              training, and lack of mentorship. In order to help address these
              challenges and strengthen translational research in Canada, the
              CFMS should: (1) Support efforts to collect data on
              clinician-scientist training program enrollment and outcomes, in
              order to be able to make evidence-based decisions and thus more
              effectively administer clinician-scientist training programs; (2)
              Support the existing call for the CIHR to re-establish funding for
              MD/PhD trainees and create a national oversight body for
              clinician-scientist training programs; and (3) Support closer
              integration of clinician-scientist trainees with their colleagues
              in medical training during research phases of their training.
            paper-status: >-
              As of Spring 2016: (1) The Clinician Investigator Trainee
              Association of Canada (CITAC), in collaboration with UBC and the
              Canadian Society for Clinical Investigation (CSCI), is currently
              in the process of collecting data that could help inform
              decision-making regarding the administration of
              clinician-scientist training programs. (2) Several organizations
              and programs across Canada are calling for the CIHR to either
              re-establish funding for the MD/PhD programs or create an
              alternative funding program.

              Paper is well written has the following recommendations pertaining
              to mental health and career development: 1) Canadian medical
              schools (and student-led organizations) should develop formal and
              informal wellness support initiatives. 2) Canadian medical
              faculties should promote safe learning environment for all medical
              students. 3) Medical schools should develop and promote
              accessible, realizable and standardized accomodation policies for
              medical students in each phase of UM training 4) Support research
              exploring wellness in learning and evaluation of mental health and
              wellness
            paper-status: >-
              The paper addresses a very current wide-spread concern at medical
              schools. There have been various school specific initiatives, but
              also province wide initiatives such as the Ontario medical
              students association's wellness retreat. There is a mental health
              communique at UofT, Faculty Wellness Program at UOttawa. I believe
              the next steps can be for the CFMS to endorse school specific
              mental health programs and by bringing light to them, encourage
              other schools/organizations to take part.

            paper-summary: >-
              This paper puts forward a number of policies on creating a safe
              and supportive learning environment for clinical clerks at
              Canadian medical schools. The three key recommendations advanced
              are: 1) Medical schools and hospitals should provide adequate
              resources to clerks to support learning, 2) Medical schools should
              support clerks in their personal and professional development, and
              3) Medical schools and hospitals should update their policies
              concerning the safety and security of clerks
            paper-status: >-
              The policies surrounding clerkship in Canada are medical
              school-specific, and there currently exists no national guidelines
              on the learning environment of clinical clerks in Canada

              Human trafficking is a relevant concern for Canadian HCP with
              severe effects on health and wellbeing of victims. Medical
              students and HCP are not adequately trained to recognize and
              assist victims. This paper advocates for curriculum incorporation
              of elements of raising awareness, providing validated screening
              tools and teaching how to identify and counsel vulnerable
              populations.

            paper-summary: >-
              In light of the need for medical students to develop their
              advocacy and leadership skills to be better prepared to advocate
              for the health needs of the patients and populations they serve,
              this paper calls for the creation of a mandatory Advocacy and
              Leadership Curriculum (ALC) in Canadian medical schools. This
              document is intended as a comprehensive resource for the CFMS and
              its members to support the integration and evaluation of ALCs in
              Canadian medical schools to enhance their social accountability.
              This paper includes proposed curriculum details such as the three
              spheres of health advocacy (patient level, institution level, and
              population level), advocacy preceptors, and health advocacy
              projects. Moreover, this paper includes several theoretical,
              skill-based, and application-based Learning Objectives that ALCs
              should address; a sample curriculum; sample competencies; and
              proposed implementation and evaluation guidelines.

              As of March 2016: While many medical students learn about the
              social determinants of health, little is taught in medical schools
              about the advocacy and leadership skills needed to act on this
              understanding of social issues in medicine. Some medical schools
              have faculty-supported advocacy curricula (e.g., the LEAD program
              at the University of Toronto) and some student-led health advocacy
              activities currently exist (e.g., lobby days). However, there is
              still a pressing need for increased social accountability in
              medical schools.

              Climate change and global health: Training future physicians to
              act and mitigate

              Climate change poses several indirect hazards to human health,
              such as increasing incidence of vector-borne infectious diseases,
              cardio-respiratory related conditions and similar non-communicable
              diseases, as well as major disturbances to food and water systems.
              At particularly high risk are vulnerable populations such as the
              Inuit, who continue to witness firsthand current effects of
              climate change on their personal and ecosystem health. This is
              seen in greater trauma-related physical hazards due to melting
              ice, decreased stability of infrastructure due to melting
              permafrost, food insecurity, increased exposure to infectious
              disease through the sudden introduction of invasive species, water
              shortages and potential malnourishment. Meanwhile, direct impact
              of heat and air quality will likely be highest in Vancouver and
              Toronto, where annual cost of premature mortality risk
              attributable to climate change is expected to add up to $6.2
              billion annually. Mitigation measures such as air quality control
              can result in health co-benefits that offset cost of carbon
              policies by 1050%, whereas infrastructure modifications such as
              public transportation and urban settlement can further decrease
              risks of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and
              cardiovascular diseases.
            paper-status: >-
              The health community, through public and private institutions, is
              currently focusing on four overarching adaptions: researching
              health effects of climate change (through Health Canada, Canadian
              universities, etc.), activities at the federal, regional and
              health institutional level that directly or indirectly protect
              health, assessments of current levels of health adaptions in
              response to climate change, and communication of climate change
              health risks to the public. Health professionals who have
              participated in climate change advocacy have made significant
              contributions towards mitigation measures, such as air pollution
              research led by the CMA resulting in the decision to the phase out
              of coal-fired electricity in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta.
              Furthermore, health professionals have been involved in building
              assessment tools for tracking levels of health adaptions in
              response to climate change, such as the Air Quality Health Index
              (AQHI), heat alert response systems, and health vulnerability
              assessments. However, more work could be done to assess the
              effectiveness of such adaptions. At the undergraduate and
              postgraduate level in medical education, environmental health is
              one of the learning objects in Canadian medical education, but is
              not comprehensively explored. A successful example to look at when
              modelling climate change related medical education may include the
              work of the Sustainable Healthcare Education Network, which is a
              group of clinicians, students and academics in the UK dedicated to
              preparing health professionals for working in a low carbon health
              system.

            paper-summary: >-
              Resource stewardship is a concept focused on improving the quality
              of patient care by reducing the use of unnecessary medical testing
              and treatment, which is associated with false positives, increased
              patient anxiety, and preventable patient harm. As physicians
              control 80% of healthcare costs, it is crucial for medical
              students to learn and adopt practices in alignment of resource
              stewardship principles. The CFMS recognizes the importance of
              integrating resource stewardship into medical school curricula,
              and has created a list of behavioral recommendations for trainees
              aimed at creating a medical culture that celebrates the attitude
              of “less is more.” Going forward, there exists many opportunities
              to promote and support student-led initiatives focused on resource
              stewardship.
            paper-status: >-
              The University of Toronto has been a pioneer in the incorporation
              of resource stewardship into their curriculum, working closely
              with Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) to integrate it within all four
              years of their MD program. Other schools have also begun to do so,
              with many initatives being championed by students, such as the
              Students for Antimicrobial Stewardship Society. The CWC has also
              launched the STARS campaign, in which two medical students from
              each school are selected to champion the principles of resource
              stewardship at their school. In 2014, Canadian medical students
              and the CWC collaborated to create an online module for the
              Institute for Health Care Improvement titled "An Introduction to
              Quality, Value, and Cost in Health Care", which is the most
              popular non-mandatory module.

              A 2014 study (DOI: 10.3402/meo.v19.25181) on the heterogenity of
              information included on MSPR concluded that the information
              included in MSPR varied significantly between medical schools and
              concluded that standardization may be necessary in order for fair
              comparison to be made. However, no further action has been taken
              on this issue.

            paper-summary: >-
              The Canadian organ and tissue donation system relies heavily on
              physicians, who 1) identify and refer possible donors; 2)
              sensitively approach the caregivers of the deceseased; and #)
              provide appropriate patient education about consenting to organ
              donation. However, meidcal students and physicians posess limited
              knowledge for maximixing procurement rates. Despite this, organ
              and tissue donation is notably absent from most Canadian medical
              school curricula, posing a significant risk to the safety of
              patients and the public. This paper recommends the integration of
              a standardized, evidence-based course on organ and tissue donation
              into undergraduate medical curricula across Canada, responding
              both to the relevant LMCC objectives and the need for physicians
              to be able to provide effective counselling of patients and
              families.

              encouraged the implementation of a similar curriculum in medical
              schools across Canada. It is not known whether this has been
              implemented at other schools across Canada (this would be worth
              looking into but would require directly contacting the schools or
              students from each school). To the best of my knowledge there is
              not a similar curriculum at the University of Calgary (my medical

              Given the important role that clinician-scientists play in
              advancing evidence-based medicine, clinician-scientist training in
              Canada should be strengthened. Challenges currently encountered by
              clinician-scientist trainees include financial barriers, length of
              training, and lack of mentorship. In order to help address these
              challenges and strengthen translational research in Canada, the
              CFMS should: (1) Support efforts to collect data on
              clinician-scientist training program enrollment and outcomes, in
              order to be able to make evidence-based decisions and thus more
              effectively administer clinician-scientist training programs; (2)
              Support the existing call for the CIHR to re-establish funding for
              MD/PhD trainees and create a national oversight body for
              clinician-scientist training programs; and (3) Support closer
              integration of clinician-scientist trainees with their colleagues
              in medical training during research phases of their training.

              Paper is well written has the following recommendations pertaining
              to mental health and career development: 1) Canadian medical
              schools (and student-led organizations) should develop formal and
              informal wellness support initiatives. 2) Canadian medical
              faculties should promote safe learning environment for all medical
              students. 3) Medical schools should develop and promote
              accessible, realizable and standardized accomodation policies for
              medical students in each phase of UM training 4) Support research
              exploring wellness in learning and evaluation of mental health and
              wellness
            paper-status: >-
              The paper addresses a very current wide-spread concern at medical
              schools. There have been various school specific initiatives, but
              also province wide initiatives such as the Ontario medical
              students association's wellness retreat. There is a mental health
              communique at UofT, Faculty Wellness Program at UOttawa. I believe
              the next steps can be for the CFMS to endorse school specific
              mental health programs and by bringing light to them, encourage
              other schools/organizations to take part.

            paper-summary: >-
              This paper puts forward a number of policies on creating a safe
              and supportive learning environment for clinical clerks at
              Canadian medical schools. The three key recommendations advanced
              are: 1) Medical schools and hospitals should provide adequate
              resources to clerks to support learning, 2) Medical schools should
              support clerks in their personal and professional development, and
              3) Medical schools and hospitals should update their policies
              concerning the safety and security of clerks
            paper-status: >-
              The policies surrounding clerkship in Canada are medical
              school-specific, and there currently exists no national guidelines
              on the learning environment of clinical clerks in Canada
