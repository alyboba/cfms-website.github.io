**Note on CFMS President:**

The President is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the CFMS. Most Presidents have had experience on the CFMS executive and should have detailed knowledge of all policy and activities of the organization. In addition to setting the priorities of the organization, the President acts as the primary contact on important issues for students and external organizations. The President attends many external meetings as the representative of Canadian medical students and will often travel an average of two weekends a month for the duration of the one-year term. Major commitments include Board Director of the Canadian Medical Forum, CFMS representative at the national Physician Resource Planning Advisory Committee (PRPAC), liaison to the Association of Faculties of Medicine (AFMC) Residency Matching and Learner privacy groups, liaison to the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) and a multitude of taskforces and subcommittees. The President will often be asked to present at different meetings and speak with media about issues affecting medical students. 

The President is also heavily involved in all activities of the executive and works with other executive members to ensure that the priorities of the organization are met. Time on email (internal and external) can exceed 2 hours per day during busy periods. Agendas and planning for executive meetings and teleconferences as well as the three meetings of the CFMS board also fall under this position. Presidential responsibilities also include liaising with the office staff person on a daily basis and ensuring that the infrastructure of the organization is in good order. 

The position of President is a one-year post, elected by the board at the Spring General Meeting. Following the end of their term, the president assumes the official role of past-president. 

The 2018-2019 President is Capt. Stephanie Smith, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, who may be reached at [presidentelect@cfms.org](presidentelect@cfms.org).
