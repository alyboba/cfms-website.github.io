A tremendous amount of work and preparation went into the [2018 CFMS National Medical Student Day of Action on Indigenous Mental Wellness](https://www.cfms.org/what-we-do/advocacy/day-of-action.html). Following the passing of the CFMS position paper entitled, [Mental Health and Suicide in Indigenous Communities in Canada](https://www.cfms.org/files/position-papers/sgm_2017_indigenous_mental_health.pdf), in April 2017, the wheels were set in motion. An extensive effort from medical students across multiple portfolios contributed to the discussions and work in making this advocacy effort possible. A thorough community consultation process was implemented to gather guidance and support from Indigenous community leaders, health experts, and institutional/organizational leads. This year marked a unique shift in our efforts to communicate extensively and build relationships with community and government, in hopes of a strong, meaningful, and respectful effort to exercise our voices as medical students in a position of speaking from our own truths.

The National Medical Student Day of Action on Indigenous Mental Wellness Summer Studentship Opportunity is a means to continue the follow-up work on the topic of Indigenous Mental Wellness that the CFMS identified as a key priority as a longitudinal advocacy effort demonstrating values of sustainability, accountability, and capacity building.

**Details of the summer studentship opportunity: **

$4,000 to be paid to a medical student for a minimum of 8 weeks of research work commitment, with 35-hour weeks.
