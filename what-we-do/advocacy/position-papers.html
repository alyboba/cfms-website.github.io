Despite this, organ and tissue donation is notably absent from most Canadian medical school curricula, posing a significant risk to the safety of patients and the public. This paper recommends the integration of a standardized, evidence-based course on organ and tissue donation into undergraduate medical curricula across Canada, responding both to the relevant LMCC objectives and the need for physicians to be able to provide effective counselling of patients and families.', '"*Note that this paper is not categorized on the cfms website (it is only listed under the ""recently added"" papers).

This paper encouraged the implementation of a similar curriculum in medical schools across Canada. It is not known whether this has been implemented at other schools across Canada (this would be worth looking into but would require directly contacting the schools or students from each school). To the best of my knowledge there is not a similar curriculum at the University of Calgary (my medical school).

As physicians control 80% of healthcare costs, it is crucial for medical students to learn and adopt practices in alignment of resource stewardship principles. The CFMS recognizes the importance of integrating resource stewardship into medical school curricula, and has created a list of behavioral recommendations for trainees aimed at creating a medical culture that celebrates the attitude of “less is more.” Going forward, there exists many opportunities to promote and support student-led initiatives focused on resource stewardship.', 'The University of Toronto has been a pioneer in the incorporation of resource stewardship into their curriculum, working closely with Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) to integrate it within all four years of their MD program. Other schools have also begun to do so, with many initatives being championed by students, such as the Students for Antimicrobial Stewardship Society. The CWC has also launched the STARS campaign, in which two medical students from each school are selected to champion the principles of resource stewardship at their school. In 2014, Canadian medical students and the CWC collaborated to create an online module for the Institute for Health Care Improvement titled "An Introduction to Quality, Value, and Cost in Health Care", which is the most popular non-mandatory module.', '/files/position-papers/2016_integration of resource stewardship in medical education.pdf');">Less is More: Integration of Resource Stewardship in Medical Education</span></li>

                           <span class="paper-title" onclick="showPaperSummary('Climate change poses several indirect hazards to human health, such as increasing incidence of vector-borne infectious diseases, cardio-respiratory related conditions and similar non-communicable diseases, as well as major disturbances to food and water systems. At particularly high risk are vulnerable populations such as the Inuit, who continue to witness firsthand current effects of climate change on their personal and ecosystem health. This is seen in greater trauma-related physical hazards due to melting ice, decreased stability of infrastructure due to melting permafrost, food insecurity, increased exposure to infectious disease through the sudden introduction of invasive species, water shortages and potential malnourishment. Meanwhile, direct impact of heat and air quality will likely be highest in Vancouver and Toronto, where annual cost of premature mortality risk attributable to climate change is expected to add up to $6.2 billion annually. Mitigation measures such as air quality control can result in health co-benefits that offset cost of carbon policies by 1050%, whereas infrastructure modifications such as public transportation and urban settlement can further decrease risks of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.', 'The health community, through public and private institutions, is currently focusing on four overarching adaptions: researching health effects of climate change (through Health Canada, Canadian universities, etc.), activities at the federal, regional and health institutional level that directly or indirectly protect health, assessments of current levels of health adaptions in response to climate change, and communication of climate change health risks to the public. Health professionals who have participated in climate change advocacy have made significant contributions towards mitigation measures, such as air pollution research led by the CMA resulting in the decision to the phase out of coal-fired electricity in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta. Furthermore, health professionals have been involved in building assessment tools for tracking levels of health adaptions in response to climate change, such as the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), heat alert response systems, and health vulnerability assessments. However, more work could be done to assess the effectiveness of such adaptions. At the undergraduate and postgraduate level in medical education, environmental health is one of the learning objects in Canadian medical education, but is not comprehensively explored. A successful example to look at when modelling climate change related medical education may include the work of the Sustainable Healthcare Education Network, which is a group of clinicians, students and academics in the UK dedicated to preparing health professionals for working in a low carbon health system.', '/files/position-papers/2016_climate change and gh training.pdf');">Climate change and global health: Training future physicians to act and mitigate</span></li>

This document is intended as a comprehensive resource for the CFMS and its members to support the integration and evaluation of ALCs in Canadian medical schools to enhance their social accountability. This paper includes proposed curriculum details such as the three spheres of health advocacy (patient level, institution level, and population level), advocacy preceptors, and health advocacy projects. Moreover, this paper includes several theoretical, skill-based, and application-based Learning Objectives that ALCs should address; a sample curriculum; sample competencies; and proposed implementation and evaluation guidelines.', 'As of March 2016: While many medical students learn about the social determinants of health, little is taught in medical schools about the advocacy and leadership skills needed to act on this understanding of social issues in medicine. Some medical schools have faculty-supported advocacy curricula (e.g., the LEAD program at the University of Toronto) and some student-led health advocacy activities currently exist (e.g., lobby days). However, there is still a pressing need for increased social accountability in medical schools.', '/files/position-papers/2016_advocacy and leadership.pdf');">Advocacy and Leadership in Canadian Medical Student Curricula</span></li>
